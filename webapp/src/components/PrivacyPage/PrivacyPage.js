        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Last Updated: February 5, 2018</p>

        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          1.1 Decentraland recognizes that people who use Decentraland value
          their privacy. This Privacy Policy details important information
          regarding the collection, use and disclosure of User information
          collected on the Decentraland website located at&nbsp;
          <a href="https://decentraland.org">https://decentraland.org/</a> (the
          “Site”), and any other features, tools, materials, or other services
          (including co-branded or affiliated services) offered from time to
          time by Decentraland (the “Service”). Decentraland provides this
          Privacy Policy to help you understand how your personal information is
          used by us and your choices regarding our use of it. By using the Site
          or Service, you agree that we can collect, use, disclose, and process
          your information as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy
          Policy only applies to the Site and Service, and not to any other
          websites, products or services you may be able to access or link to
          via the Site or Service. We encourage you to read the privacy policies
          of any other websites you visit before providing your information to
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          While our values will not shift, the Site and Service will evolve over
          time, and this Privacy Policy will change to reflect that evolution.
          If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top
          of this Privacy Policy. In some cases, if we make significant changes,
          we may give you additional notice by adding a statement to our
          homepage. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically
          to stay informed about our practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of third-party providers may place cookies or pixels - small data
          files stored on your hard drive or in device memory - on your browser
          or hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of
          cookies or pixels by such third parties. Most web browsers are set to
          accept cookies and pixels by default, but you can usually set your
          browser to remove or reject browser cookies or pixels. If you do
          choose to remove or reject cookies or pixels, however, your ability to
          use the Site or the Service might be affected.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.2 This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with our Terms
          of Use, available at (
          <a href="https://market.decentraland.org/terms">
            https://market.decentraland.org/terms

          collection and use practices described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.3 Your use of the Service and any personal information you provide
          through the Service remains subject to the terms of this Privacy
          Policy and our Terms of Use, as each may be updated from time to time.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>
          2.1 Network information regarding transactions, including, among other
          things, the type of device you use, access times, hardware model,
          operating system and version, and other unique device identifiers.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.3 We may receive network information from you as a result of your
          interaction with our Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.4 Our service requires the highest level of browser permissions that
          could potentially lead to procurement of more personal information.
          Information on how we use these permissions for a limited purpose, and
          why this is necessary, can be found in paragraph 3 below.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.5 Your interactions with the Site are documented via Google
          Analytics and that information is processed by Google.
        </p>

        <h3>3. The Way Decentraland Uses Your Personal Information</h3>
        <p>
          3.1 As with nearly all interactions that take place on the World Wide
          Web, our servers may receive information by virtue of your interaction
          with them, including but not limited to IP Addresses.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.2 Our service requires full browser permissions that could
          potentially be used to access additional personal information. Such
          browser permissions are used for an extremely limited technical
          purpose for allowing the Service to properly interact with your
          browser. No additional information is obtained beyond what is
          necessary to provide the Service. No information received is shared
          with any third-party except those affiliated with Decentraland or as
          required for provision of the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.3 Decentraland uses Google Analytics for purposes of monitoring
          webtraffic. Any identifying information collected via Google Analytics
          is controlled by Google.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.4 Public blockchains provide transparency into transactions and
          Decentraland is not responsible for preventing or managing information
          broadcasted on a blockchain.
        </p>

        <h3>4. What We Do With Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>
          4.1 Decentraland may use the information we collect in the following
          ways: To analyze trends for how the Site and Service are being used;
          To improve the Site and Service; To help personalize your experience
          of the Site and Service; and If you gave us your contact information,
          we may use that information to contact you to send you technical
          notices, updates, confirmations, security alerts, to provide support
          to you, to tell you about other products and services that we think
          might interest you, or to respond to your comments or questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.2 Decentraland may share the information we collect with third
          parties who need to access it in order to do work on our behalf,
          including doing things like helping us make the Site or Service
          available, or providing analytics services for us. We work hard to
          ensure that these third parties only access and use your information
          as necessary to perform their functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.3 Decentraland may create aggregations and anonymizations that
          contain your information in a way that does not directly identify you.
          Decentraland may use and/or share those aggregations and
          anonymizations for a variety of purposes related to the Site, the
          Service, or our company and its business.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.4 Decentraland may disclose your personal information to our
          subsidiaries, affiliated companies, agents, businesses, or service
          providers who process your personal information on our behalf in
          providing the Service to you. Our agreements with these service
          providers limit the kinds of information they can use or process and
          ensure they use reasonable efforts to keep your personal information
          secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.5 Decentraland also reserves the right to disclose personal
          information that Decentraland believes, in good faith, is appropriate
          or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against
          liability or harm, to investigate and respond to third-party claims or
          allegations, to respond to court orders or official requests, to
          protect the security or integrity of our Service, and to protect the
          rights, property, or safety of Decentraland, our users or others.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.6 In the event that Decentraland is involved in a merger,
          acquisition, sale, bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
          receivership, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the
          application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’
          rights generally, or other change of control, there may be a
          disclosure of your information to another entity related to such
          event.
        </p>

          Decentraland.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          Decentraland does not use cookies at this time but reserves the right
          to do so in the future, in which case these terms shall be updated
          accordingly.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Information We Don’t Collect</h3>

          us written feedback, communicating with us via third party social
          media sites, or otherwise communicating with us via the Site, Service
          or any other means.

          understand that transactions that take place using the Site and the
          Service are confirmed and managed via the Ethereum blockchain. You
          understand that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly
          visible whenever you engage in a transaction that is confirmed and

        <p>
          Whilst neither we, nor any other organization, can guarantee the
          security of information processed online, we do have appropriate
          security measures in place to protect your personal information. For
          example, we store the personal information you provide on computer
          systems with limited access, encryption, or both.
