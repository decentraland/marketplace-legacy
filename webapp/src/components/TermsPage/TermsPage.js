        <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
        <h3>1. Acceptance of terms</h3>
        <p>
          Decentraland provides this “LAND Manager” as a platform for managing
          cryptographic ownership in the virtual world, allowing users to
          control transactions which are then recorded in the ownership contract
          hosted on the Ethereum blockchain. The LAND Manager, and any other
          features, tools, materials, or other services offered from time to
          time by Decentraland are referred to herein as the “Service.” Please
          read these Terms of Use (the “Terms” or “Terms of Use”) carefully
          before using the Service. By using or otherwise accessing the
          Services, you (1) accept and agree to be bound by these Terms (2)
          consent to the collection, use, disclosure and other handling of
          information as described in our Privacy Policy, available at (
          <a href="https://market.decentraland.org/privacy">
            https://market.decentraland.org/privacy

          is” and “as available” basis and may contain defects and software
          bugs. You are advised to safeguard important data, property and
          content, to use caution, and to not rely in any way on the correct or
          secure functionality or performance of the Service and the LAND
          Manager. Except for Section 17, providing for binding arbitration and
          waiver of class action rights, Decentraland reserves the right, at its
          sole discretion, to modify or replace the Terms of Use at any time.
          The most current version of these Terms will be posted on our Site.
          You shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any
          such modifications. Use of the Services by you after any modification
          to the Terms constitutes your acceptance of the Terms of Use as
          modified.
        </p>

        <p>
          Access to the LAND Manager is provided via a third party private key
          manager selected by you (e.g., a Web3 Provider, Metamask, a USB
          interface for Ledger Wallet, the Mist browser, or other). Security and
          secure access to each account in the LAND Manager is provided solely
          by the third party private key manager you select to administer your
          private key. You and the third party private key manager you select
          are entirely responsible for security related to access of the LAND
          Manager. Decentraland bears no responsibility for any breach of
          security or unauthorized access to your account. You are advised to:
          (a) avoid any use of the same password with your selected third party
          private key manager that you have ever used outside of the third party
          private key manager; and (b) keep your password and any related secret
          information secure and confidential and do not share them with anyone
          else. Decentraland cannot and will not be liable for any loss or

          Ethereum blockchain. You understand that your Ethereum public address
          will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction
          using the Service.
        </p>

        <h3>5. REPRESENTATIONS AND RISKS</h3>
        <h3>5.1 Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Service is at your sole
          risk. The Service is provided on an “AS IS” and “as available” basis,
          without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including,
          without limitation, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for
          a particular purpose or non-infringement. You acknowledge and agree
          that Decentraland has no control over, and no duty to take any action
          regarding: which users gain access to or use the Service; what effects
          the Service may have on you; the land you own; how you may interpret
          or use the Service; or what actions you may take or fail to take as a
          result of having been exposed to the Service. You release Decentraland
          from all liability for your inability to access to the Service or any
          content therein. Decentraland is not and cannot be responsible for and
          makes no representations, warranties or covenants concerning any
          content contained in or accessed through the Service, and Decentraland
          will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright
          compliance, legality or decency of material contained in or accessed
          through the Service.
        </p>

        <h3>5.2 Sophistication and Risk of Cryptographic Systems</h3>
        <p>
          By utilizing the Service or interacting with the Service or platform
          or anything contained or provided therein in any way, you represent
          that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic
          systems; and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage and
          intricacies of native cryptographic tokens, like Ether (ETH) and
          Bitcoin (BTC), smart contract based tokens such as those that follow
          the Ethereum Token Standard (<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20">
            https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20
          </a>), MANA, and blockchain-based software systems.
        </p>

        <h3>5.3 Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions</h3>
        <p>
          Decentraland, MANA, LAND, and ETH could be impacted by one or more
          regulatory inquiries or regulatory action, which could impede or limit
          the ability of Decentraland to continue to develop, or which could
          impede or limit your ability to access or use the Service or Ethereum
          blockchain. New regulations or policies may materially adversely
          affect the development of the Decentraland ecosystem, and therefore
          the potential utility or value of land parcels and Mana.
        </p>

        <h3>5.4 Risk of Weaknesses or Exploits in the Field of Cryptography</h3>
        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that cryptography is a progressing field.
          Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the
          development of quantum computers may present risks to
          cryptocurrencies, the Service, and the LAND Manager, which could
          result in the theft or loss of your cryptographic tokens or property.
          To the extent possible, Decentraland intends to undertake reasonable
          measures to update the protocol underlying the Service to account for
          any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security
          measures that Decentraland should become aware of, but Decentraland
          does not guarantee or otherwise represent that Decentraland can
          provide security for the system. By using the Service and the LAND
          manager, you acknowledge and agree to undertake these risks.
        </p>

        <h3>5.5 Volatility of Crypto Currencies</h3>
        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that MANA, Ether and blockchain technologies
          and associated currencies tokens, and other assets are highly volatile
          due to many factors including but not limited to popularity, adoption,
          speculation, regulation, technology and security risks. You also
          acknowledge and agree that the cost of transacting on such
          technologies is variable and may increase at any time causing impact
          to any activities taking place on the Ethereum blockchain. You
          acknowledge and agree these risks and represent that Decentraland
          cannot be held liable for changes and fluctuations in value or
          increased costs.
        </p>

        <h3>5.6 Application Security</h3>
        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that the Service and related applications
          are software code and are subject to flaws and acknowledge that you
          are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided by the
          Services or Content and the trustworthiness of any third-party
          websites, products, smart-contracts, or Content you access or use
          through the Service. You further expressly acknowledge and agree that
          Ethereum applications can be written maliciously or negligently, that
          Decentraland cannot be held liable for your interaction with such
          applications and that such applications may cause the loss of property
          or even identity. This warning and others later provided by
          Decentraland in no way evidence or represent an on-going duty to alert
          you to all of the potential risks of utilizing the Service.
        </p>

        <p>
          5.7 Decentraland neither owns nor controls MetaMask, Ledger Wallet,
          the Mist browser, Google Chrome, the Ethereum network, any Web3
          Provider or any other third party site, product, or service that you
          might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the
          various features of the Service. We shall not be liable for the acts
          or omissions of any such third parties, nor shall we be liable for any
          damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any
          other interaction with any such third parties.
        </p>

        <p>
          5.8 You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes
          apply to your land parcel related transactions. Decentraland is not
          responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions
          entered through the Service or otherwise involving any land parcel.
        </p>

        <p>
          5.9 You acknowledge and agree that the Service does not store, send,
          or receive land parcels. This is because land parcels exist only by
          virtue of the ownership record maintained on the Service’s supporting
          blockchain in the Ethereum network. Any transfer of land parcel occurs
          within the supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network, and not
          within the Service.
        </p>

        <p>
          5.10 There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency,
          including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and
          Internet connections failure or problems, the risk of malicious
          software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain
          unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You
          accept and acknowledge that Decentraland will not be responsible for
          any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays
          you may experience when using the Ethereum network, however caused.
        </p>

        <p>
          5.11 A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development
          of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of
          the Decentraland ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or
          value of land parcels and Mana.
        </p>

        <p>
          5.12 Upgrades by Ethereum to the Ethereum platform, a hard fork in the
          Ethereum platform, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on
          the Ethereum platform may have unintended, adverse effects on the
          Decentraland ecosystem.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Transactions and Fees</h3>
        <p>
          6.1 If you elect to purchase, trade, or sell a parcel with or from
          other users via the Service, any financial transactions that you
          engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network. We
          will have no insight into or control over these payments or
          transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions.
          With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third
          party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any
          transactions that you engage in via the Service, or any other
          transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum network.
        </p>

        <p>
          6.2 Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”)
          for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee
          funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum
          network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each
          transaction that occurs via the Service.
        </p>

        <p>
          6.3 As between us, you will be solely responsible to pay any and all
          sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments
          (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed
          by any governmental authority (collectively, “Taxes”) associated with
          your use of the Service (including, without limitation, any Taxes that
          may become payable as the result of your ownership, or transfer of any
          parcel). Except for income taxes levied on Decentraland, you: (i) will
          pay or reimburse us for all national, federal, state, local or other
          taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value added taxes
          and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other
          import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on
          charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now
          or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national,
          state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction; and (ii) shall not be
          entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties or assessments
          from payments made to us pursuant to these Terms.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Changes</h3>
        <p>
          We may make changes to the Terms from time to time. When we make
          changes, we will make the updated Terms available through the Service
          and update the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms
          accordingly. Please check these Terms periodically for changes. Any
          changes to the Terms will apply on the date that they are made, and
          your continued access to or use of the Service after the Terms have
          been updated will constitute your binding acceptance of the updates.
          If you do not agree to any revised Terms, you must not access or use
          the Service.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Children</h3>
        <p>
          You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Service is not
          intended for children under 13. IF YOU ARE 13 OR OLDER BUT UNDER THE
          AGE OF 18, OR THE LEGAL AGE OF MAJORITY WHERE YOU RESIDE IF THAT
          JURISDICTION HAS AN OLDER AGE OF MAJORITY, THEN YOU AGREE TO REVIEW
          THESE TERMS WITH YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH YOU
          AND YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS. YOU
          AGREE TO HAVE YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN REVIEW AND ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON
          YOUR BEHALF. IF YOU ARE A PARENT OR GUARDIAN AGREEING TO THE TERMS FOR
          THE BENEFIT OF A CHILD OVER 13, THEN YOU AGREE TO AND ACCEPT FULL
          RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT CHILD’S USE OF THE SERVICE, INCLUDING ALL
          FINANCIAL CHARGES AND LEGAL LIABILITY THAT HE OR SHE MAY INCUR.
        </p>

        <h3>9. Indemnity</h3>
        <p>
          You shall release and indemnify, defend and hold harmless Decentraland
          and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and agencies, as well as the
          officers, directors, employees, shareholders and representatives of
          any of the foregoing entities, from and against any and all losses,
          liabilities, expenses, damages, costs (including attorneys’ fees and
          court costs) claims or actions of any kind whatsoever arising or
          resulting from your use of the Service, your violation of these Terms
          of Use, and any of your acts or omissions. Decentraland reserves the
          right, at its own expense, to assume exclusive defense and control of
          any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you and, in such
          case, you agree to cooperate with Decentraland in the defense of such
          matter.
        </p>

        <p>
          PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR
          LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT
        </p>

        <h3>17.1 Initial Dispute Resolution</h3>
        <p>
          The parties shall use their best efforts to engage directly to settle
          any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith
          negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a
          lawsuit or arbitration.
        </p>

        <h3>17.2 Binding Arbitration</h3>
        <p>
          If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of
          30 days from the time informal dispute resolution under the Initial
          Dispute Resolution provision begins, then either party may initiate
          binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to
          the terms set forth below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifically, any dispute that is not resolved under the Initial
          Dispute Resolution provision shall be determined by final and binding
          arbitration under the London Court of International Arbitration
          (“LCIA”) Rules, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference
          into this clause. The following shall apply in respect of such
          arbitration: (i) the number of arbitrators shall be three (one
          nominated by each party and one nominated by the LCIA); (ii) the
          decision of the arbitrators will be binding and enforceable against
          the parties and a judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators
          may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereto (provided that
          in no event will the arbitrator have the authority to make any award
          that provides for punitive or exemplary damages or to award damages
          excluded by these Terms or in excess of the limitations contained in
          these Terms); (iii) the seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be
          London, England; and (iv) the language to be used in the arbitral
          proceedings shall be English, any documents submitted as evidence that
          are in another language must be accompanied by an English translation
          and the award will be in the English language. Claimants and
          respondents shall bear its or their own costs of the arbitration,
          including attorney&#39;s fees, and share equally the arbitrators&#39;
          fees and LCIA&#39;s administrative costs. For purposes of cost
          sharing, all claimants shall be considered one party and all
          respondents shall be considered one party. The parties shall maintain
          strict confidentiality with respect to all aspects of any arbitration
          commenced pursuant to these Terms and shall not disclose the fact,
          conduct or outcome of the arbitration to any non-parties or
          non-participants, except to the extent required by applicable Law or
          to the extent necessary to recognize, confirm or enforce the final
          award or decision in the arbitration, without the prior written
          consent of all parties to the arbitration.
        </p>

        <h3>17.3 Class Action Waiver</h3>
        <p>
          The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in
          their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other
          representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to
          file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND
          DECENTRALAND AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY
          IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
          MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any
          court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth
          in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an
          arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration
          provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its
          entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to
          arbitrate disputes.

          17.4 Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims
          Court Claims
        </h3>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding the parties&#39; decision to resolve all disputes
          through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or
          federal court to protect its intellectual property rights
          (“intellectual property rights” including patents, copyrights, moral
          rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity
          rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for
          disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.
        </p>

        <h3>17.5 30-Day Right to Opt Out</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and
          class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written
          notice of your decision to opt-out to the following email address:{' '}
          <a href="mailto:legal@decentraland.org">legal@decentraland.org</a>.
          Your notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of the
          Service, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in
          accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these
          arbitration provisions, Decentraland also will not be bound by them.
        </p>

        <h3>17.6 Changes to This Section</h3>
        <p>
          Decentraland will provide 60-days’ notice of any changes to this
          section. Changes will become effective on the 60th day, and will apply
          prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day.
        </p>

        <p>
          For any dispute not subject to arbitration you and Decentraland agree
          to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue of
          the High Court in London, under English Law. You further agree to
          accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all
          jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.
        </p>

        <p>
          These Terms and the relationship between you and Decentraland shall be
          governed by the laws of the High Court in London, under English Law,
          without regard to conflict of law provisions.
        </p>

        <h3>18. General Information</h3>
        <h3>18.1 Entire Agreement</h3>
        <p>
          These Terms (and any additional terms, rules and conditions of
          participation that Decentraland may post on the Service) constitute
          the entire agreement between you and Decentraland with respect to the
          Service and supersedes any prior agreements, oral or written, between
          you and Decentraland. In the event of a conflict between these Terms
          and the additional terms, rules and conditions of participation, the
          latter will prevail over the Terms to the extent of the conflict.
        </p>

        <h3>18.2 Waiver and Severability of Terms</h3>
        <p>
          The failure of Decentraland to exercise or enforce any right or
          provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
          provision. If any provision of the Terms is found by an arbitrator or
          court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties
          nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to
          give effect to the parties&#39; intentions as reflected in the
          provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force
          and effect.
        </p>

        <h3>18.3 Statute of Limitations</h3>
        <p>
          You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any
          claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the use of the
          Service or the Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such
          claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
        </p>

        <h3>18.4 Section Titles</h3>
        <p>
          The section titles in the Terms are for convenience only and have no
          legal or contractual effect.
